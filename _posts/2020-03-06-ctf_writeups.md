I took part in the Awesome (CSCG 2020)[https://senior.2020.cscg.de]. It was an awesome experience with well crafted challenges of which I managed to solve enough to rank Top 20 in the Senior category, quite rewarding for my first ctf :). Can't recommend it enough it was a really fun learing experience. Except polyrun. Polyrun is evil.

I published most of the writeups I finished [here](https://github.com/SpeckiJ/ctf/tree/master/cscg_2020).
